# JavaScript-Apollo Tutorial - Building a GraphQL Server from Scratch

## Overview
GraphQL is revolutionizing backend technologies, supplanting REST as the go-to API design paradigm. This tutorial guides you through constructing an idiomatic GraphQL server from the ground up, employing cutting-edge technologies like Apollo Server 2.18, Prisma, and GraphQL Playground.

### Technologies Used:
- **Apollo Server 2.18:** A feature-rich GraphQL Server prioritizing easy setup, high performance, and an excellent developer experience.
- **Prisma:** A modern alternative to traditional ORMs. Use Prisma Client to seamlessly access your database within GraphQL resolvers.
- **GraphQL Playground:** A versatile "GraphQL IDE" for interactive exploration of API functionality. Similar to Postman for REST APIs, it provides auto-generated comprehensive documentation, a query/mutation editor with auto-completion and syntax highlighting, and easy API operation sharing.

## What to Expect
The objective of this tutorial is to create an API for a Hacker News clone, taking you through the following steps:

1. **Understanding Basics:** Start by grasping the fundamentals of how a GraphQL server operates. Define a GraphQL schema and write corresponding resolver functions. Initially, these resolvers handle in-memory data, not persisting beyond server runtime.

2. **Database Integration:** Introduce a SQLite database managed with Prisma to enable data storage and persistence beyond server runtime.

3. **Advanced Features:**
    - **Authentication:** Implement signup/login functionality for user authentication, allowing permission checks for specific API operations.
    - **Filtering and Pagination:** Enhance the API by enabling consumers to limit retrieved items through filtering and pagination capabilities.
